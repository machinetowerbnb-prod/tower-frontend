The model focuses on high-yield accumulation based on capital-flow efficiency, ensuring maximum potential for both new and existing investors.": "استراتژی گردش TowerBNB بر بستر شبکه اتریوم اجرا می‌شود و از فناوری حلقه بازده ترکیبی Tower برای بهینه‌سازی پاداش‌ها استفاده می‌کند. این استراتژی با الگوریتم‌هایی که بازده را به‌صورت خودکار بیشینه می‌کنند تعامل دارد و درآمدی قابل پیش‌بینی ایجاد می‌کند.",
